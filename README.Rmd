An R package for tracking cells and analyzing their trajectories.

# Installation


You can install the current version of CellMigRation from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ocbe-uio/CellMigRation")
```

# Example

Example usage:

```{r example}
library(CellMigRation)

data(TrajectoryDataset)
df <- CellMig(TrajectoryDataset[1:100, ])
preproc <- rmPreProcessing(df, PixelSize = 1.24, TimeInterval = 100)
```

# Shiny application

Some CellMigRation features are also available as a standalone web application powered by an R package called Shiny. **The Shiny app is still under construction**, so it is not feature-complete and is not guaranteed to perform as expected. Until release, we advise you to use the R package directly.

To access the CellMigRation Shiny app, visit https://ocbe.shinyapps.io/CellMigRation/.
