# CellMigRation

An R package for tracking cells and analyzing their trajectories.


## Installation


You can install the current version of CellMigRation from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ocbe-uio/CellMigRation")
```
## Example

Example usage:

```{r example}
library(CellMigRation)

data(Trajectory_dataset)
df <- Trajectory_dataset[1:100, ]
preproc <- PreProcessing(df, PixelSize = 1.24, TimeInterval = 100)
```

## Shiny application

Some CellMigRation features are also available as a standalone web application powered by an R package called Shiny.
Once published, the app will run from a remote server which doesn't require the end user to have an R installation.
As this app is still under construction, though, it should be run from a local installation of R.

Here are two ways to run the Shiny app. Both assume the user has the `shiny` package installed.

### Running the GitHub-hosted application from a local R installation

1. From an R terminal, execute the following command:
```r
shiny::runGitHub("CellMigRation", "ocbe-uio", "shiny", "Shinyapp")
```

### Running a 100% locally-hosted application

1. Download the CellMigRation repository
2. From the root folder of the (uncompressed) file, run the following in R:
```r
shiny::runApp("Shinyapp")
```

Step 1 can be skipped if you already have a clone of CellMigRation in your machine.

### Running and disconnecting from the Shiny application

Once the Shiny app is called, a browser window should open with the running application.
After you are done using it, close the browser tab and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> in your R terminal to quit the application and regain control of the R prompt.
